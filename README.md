Frontend Developer Roadmap

An interactive learning platform built as a single HTML file. Study topics, take mini-tests, solve practice tasks, and track your progress — all without any server or installation.

Live Demo

Open on GitHub Pages after you deploy it — the URL will be:

https://kernix01.github.io/WebDevGym-EN//
What's inside

The roadmap is split into three groups:

Frontend — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Git

Backend & Extra — Node.js, SQL, Servers, Linux, Vite

Other — Guides, Practice, Common mistakes, Resources, Career path, Figma basics, Playground, Cheatsheets, GitHub

Each topic has a theory block with code examples, a mini-test (2–3 questions), and a practice task. Checkboxes unlock only after you pass both the test and the task.

Features

Progress dashboard with per-language bars and percentages
Dark and light mode
Bookmarks for topics you want to revisit
Full-text search across all topics
Built-in code playground (HTML/CSS/JS)
GitHub tab — search repos and push files directly to your repository via API
How to deploy

Option 1 — GitHub Pages (recommended)

Create a new repository on GitHub
Upload index.html to the root of the main branch
Go to Settings → Pages → Source: main branch, / (root)
Your site will be live in about a minute
Option 2 — Push from the app itself

Open the GitHub tab inside the roadmap, fill in your username, repository name, and a Personal Access Token (with repo scope), select the file and click Push. The token is never saved anywhere — it only lives in the current browser tab.

Option 3 — Local use

Just double-click index.html. No server needed.

Resetting progress

Click the Reset button in the top bar. This clears localStorage so all checkboxes go back to zero. Your bookmarks are also cleared.

Notes

Progress is saved in localStorage and persists between sessions in the same browser
Locked checkboxes (🔒) unlock only after passing the mini-test and practice task for that topic
The file is self-contained — no CDN dependencies for core functionality
